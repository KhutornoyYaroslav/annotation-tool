--- Shapes ---
Shapes based on points:
- Point
- Polyline
- Polygon
- BoundingRect
- BoundingBox
- Keypoints

Shapes based on bitmap:
- Mask

--- Objects ---
Object should have:
- Class
- Id (UUID)
- Shapes

Object can have multiple shapes. For instance, object 'Car' can
simultaneously have BoundingRect, BoundingBox, Keypoints shapes.

Should objects have predefined set of shapes or shapes can be added
dynamically? We need to set up shapes to object class in objects classes
configurator.
